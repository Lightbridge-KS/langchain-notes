T o order copies, contact reprints@rsna.orgThe present glossary of terms for thoracic imaging is the \\nfourth prepared by members of the Fleischner Society \\nand replaces the previous glossaries of terms for chest radi-\\nography (1) and CT (2,3), respectively. The impetus to up-\\ndate the previous version arose from an awareness that new \\nterms have emerged, others have become obsolete, and the \\nusage of some terms has either changed or become incon-\\nsistent to a degree that warranted a new definition. The \\nmethodology used for compiling this glossary is described \\nin Appendix S1. Appendix S2 summarizes the terms in-\\ncluded, excluded, and rearranged, compared with the pre-\\nvious version of the glossary.\\nThe intention of this latest glossary is not to be exhaus-\\ntive but to focus on terms of clinical importance and those \\nwhose meaning may be perceived as vague or ambigu-\\nous. This focus is important to establish standardization \\nof terminology and, thereby, to facilitate communications \\nbetween radiologists and other clinicians. Moreover, the \\ncurrent glossary aims for more stringent, consistent termi-\\nnology required by structured reporting and essential for \\nreasonably accurate searches in large databases (4,5).\\nControversial or misused terms are also included, with \\nrecommendations for appropriate usage. Whenever this is \\nnot supported by objective evidence, the consensus prefer-\\nence of the authors is clearly identified. In this regard, the \\ncurrent glossary is not only an enumeration of terms and their definitions, but also a commentary regarding their \\nuse.\\nAs in previous versions, terms and techniques not spe-\\ncific to thoracic imaging are not included. Despite sporadic \\nreferences to fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose PET/\\nCT, most definitions continue to refer to chest radiogra-\\nphy and CT, which remain the chief modalities used in \\nthoracic imaging. The overall number of terms was kept \\nalmost identical. However, several features are new.\\nFirst, the glossary preserves the alphabetical order of \\nterms, but several related terms are now grouped under \\nthematic headings to allow a rapid overview for compar-\\ning individual terms. The number of imaging signs was \\nreduced, as these are comprehensively described elsewhere \\n(6–8). Likewise, the number of eponyms was reduced to a \\nminimum, and preference was given to descriptive terms, \\nwhenever possible. Most terms continue to have a limited \\nnumber of pertinent and updated references, but not all \\nterms are referenced.\\nSecond, for brevity, the glossary no longer includes sub-\\ndivisions into pathology, radiographic, and CT definitions. \\nEach term is now labeled to either reflect normal anatomy \\n(anatomy), a physiologic concept (physiology), or an abnor-\\nmal finding (pathology). It is important to emphasize that \\nthis is a glossary of radiologic terms and that, while often \\ngrounded in radiology-pathology correlations, terms labeled Members of the Fleischner Society have compiled a glossary of terms for thoracic imaging that replaces previous glossaries published in \\n1984, 1996, and 2008, respectively. The impetus to update the previous version arose from multiple considerations. These include an \\nawareness that new terms and concepts have emerged, others have become obsolete, and the usage of some terms has either changed or \\nbecome inconsistent to a degree that warranted a new definition. This latest glossary is focused on terms of clinical importance and on \\nthose whose meaning may be perceived as vague or ambiguous. As with previous versions, the aim of the present glossary is to establish \\nstandardization of terminology for thoracic radiology and, thereby, to facilitate communications between radiologists and other clini-\\ncians. Moreover, the present glossary aims to contribute to a more stringent use of terminology, increasingly required for structured \\nreporting and accurate searches in large databases. Compared with the previous version, the number of images (chest radiography and \\nCT) in the current version has substantially increased.

Some terms are labeled as descriptors to differ-\\nentiate them from terms that imply a radiologic diagnosis. Terms \\ndescribed elsewhere are cross-referenced by an asterisk (*).\\nThird, the glossary includes images for virtually all terms, and \\nwe hope that this will increase its practical value. While images \\nwere chosen to be typical for a given term, they are merely ex-\\namples and do not represent the full range of possible imaging \\nappearances, which may be found in the references of this glos-\\nsary and in comprehensive textbooks.\\nWe hope that this fourth edition of the Fleischner Society \\nGlossary of Terms for Thoracic Imaging will be helpful for both \\nradiologists and the respiratory medicine community at large. \\nBecause terminology is evolving, the provided definitions should \\nbe understood as a consensus proposal rather than strict rules. It \\nis anticipated that systematic evaluations of the utilization of this \\nglossary will be undertaken.\\nAcinus (Pl. Acini) (Anatomy)\\nThe acinus is a structural unit of the lung distal to the terminal \\nbronchiole* and is supplied by a first-order respiratory bronchi-\\nole, with a diameter of approximately 4-8 mm. The secondary \\npulmonary lobule* contains between three and 25 acini. Within \\nthe acinus, all parts are involved in gas exchange (ie, they contain \\nalveoli). The acinus consists of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar \\nducts, and alveoli. Normal acini are not visible radiologically but \\nthe accumulation of pathologic material within acini may be \\nseen as small ill-defined rounded opacities (opacity*), sometimes \\ncalled “air space nodules” (9,10).\\nAir Bronchogram (Pathology) [Descriptor] (Fig 1)\\nAir bronchogram is the descriptive term for air-filled airways* \\nwithin lung parenchyma* that is partially or completely air-\\nless. The term implies (a) patency of proximal airways, and (b) \\nevacuation of alveolar air by means of absorption (eg, in atelec-\\ntasis*) or replacement (eg, fluid, tumor), or a combination of \\nthese processes (11).\\nAir Crescent (Pathology) [Descriptor] (Figs 2, 3)\\nAir crescent is the descriptive term for a crescent-shaped air \\ncollection between the wall of a cavity* and a mass* within \\nthe cavity. It is often associated with the retraction of infarcted \\nlung parenchyma* in angio-invasive aspergillosis or with the \\ncolonization of preexisting cavities by Aspergillus or other \\nfungi. In the latter case, the resulting fungus ball* may be mo-\\nbile and change position with changes in the patient’s position. \\nAir crescents can also occur due to necrotic tissue or a blood \\nclot within a cavity* (12,13).\\nAir Trapping (Physiology/Pathology) (Fig 4)\\nAir trapping is the retention of air in lung parenchyma* distal \\nto more proximal obstruction of one or several airways*. Air \\ntrapping (also “gas trapping”) is seen at CT performed during \\nor at the end of expiration. It is characterized by (a) a less-\\nthan-normal increase in attenuation and (b) a less-than-normal \\ndecrease in volume on expiration. Air trapping should only be called on expiratory CT examinations (14). Of note, areas of \\nair trapping are typically sharply marginated, however distinc-\\ntion between air trapping and decreased attenuation due to \\nvascular occlusion, for example in chronic thromboembolic \\ndisease, may be difficult (15,16). Air trapping is also frequently \\nassociated with decreased focal perfusion (eg, caused by reac-\\ntive vasoconstriction) (17–19).\\nAirspace (Anatomy)\\nAn airspace is the air- or gas-containing part of the lung paren-\\nchyma*, including the respiratory bronchioles (bronchiole*), \\nalveolar ducts, and alveoli, but excluding purely conductive air-\\nways* such as terminal bronchioles. The term is used in conjunc-\\ntion with opacity* and nodule* to designate the accumulation of \\nmaterial within airspaces (20).\\nAirways (Anatomy)\\nThe airways are structural parts of the respiratory system that al-\\nlow airflow. Conducting airways extend from the nares and buccal \\nopening to the terminal bronchioles (bronchiole*). Large airways \\ninclude the cervical and thoracic part of the trachea, as well as \\nthe main, lobar, and segmental bronchi. Small airways include the \\nsubsegmental bronchi to bronchioles with an internal diameter of \\nless than 2 mm. Diseases of the central airways can often be visual-\\nized directly at CT, whereas diseases of the peripheral airways often \\nmanifest through indirect changes (eg, air trapping*) (21–23).\\nAnatomic Distribution (Anatomy) (Figs 5–25)\\n• Bronchocentric: adjacent to or involving the bronchi in \\nthe axial interstitium* (Fig 5).\\n• Centrilobular: centered on the core structures of the sec-\\nondary pulmonary lobule* (Figs 6, 7). Often used to \\ndescribe the distribution of nodules (nodule*) or mi-\\ncronodules (micronodule*).\\n• Diffuse: distributed throughout a lobe* or lobes without \\nparticular regional predominance, for example be-\\ntween central and peripheral parts of the lung (Fig 8).\\n• Endobronchial: located within the lumen of a bronchus \\n(Figs 9, 10).\\n• Extrapleural: external to the pleura, without directly in-\\nvolving the pleura* or the pleural space (Fig 11).\\n• Fissural: refers to a lesion or disease that arises from or in-\\nvolves the fissure* (Fig 12). A lesion or disease that has \\ndirect contact with the fissure*, but does not arise from \\nit, should be called “perifissural.”\\n• Focal: confined to one distinct area (Fig 13).\\n• Geographic: distributed in a manner resembling the out-\\nline of regions on a map. The term implies well-defined \\nmargins between areas of differing attenuation (Fig 14).'),\n",

A lesion or disease that has \\ncontact with the pleura*, but does not arise from it, \\nshould be called pleura-based. The term subpleural  \\nshould only be used for lesions or diseases in prox-\\nimity to the pleura*, but without direct contact to \\nit. Because this term has been attributed variable \\nmeanings in the literature, the term peripheral is pre-\\nferred to describe such lesions or diseases. Of note, \\nimaging cannot always determine whether a given \\nlesion is located between two layers of pleura or \\nwithin the pleura, or in the parenchyma and directly \\ncontiguous to the pleura (Figs 23–25).\\nThe prefix juxta- has been used inconsistently to describe le-\\nsions that are variously in proximity or in contact with the pleura* \\nor a fissure* (juxtafissural, juxtapleural) (24). We recommend \\ninstead using the more stringent terminology described above.\\nAortopulmonary Window (Anatomy) (Fig 26)\\nThe aortopulmonary window is a mediastinal compartment \\ndelimited anteriorly by the ascending aorta, posteriorly by the \\ndescending aorta, cranially by the aortic arch, caudally by the left \\npulmonary artery, medially by the trachea and the lateral wall of \\nthe left main bronchus, and laterally by the medial pleura* cover-\\ning the left lung. The aortopulmonary window contains lymph \\nnodes (lymph node*) and connective tissue and is traversed by \\nthe left phrenic nerve, the left vagus nerve, the left recurrent la-\\nryngeal nerve, and the left bronchial arteries. It is separated into \\na medial and lateral part by the ligamentum arteriosum (25).\\nApical Cap (Pathology) (Fig 27)\\nApical caps are cap-like rims at the lung apices, often bilateral, \\nusually caused by pulmonary and/or pleural fibrosis* displac-\\ning extrapleural fat. Chronic ischemia causing a plaque of elas-\\ntotic fibrosis of the visceral pleura*, with or without subpleural \\nlung parenchyma*, has been suggested as the potential patho-\\ngenesis, which is variably associated with aging. In addition, \\napical caps can be caused by fluid collections associated with \\ninfection, neoplasms, or trauma, either extrapleural or within \\nthe pleural space. A left apical cap can be caused by hematoma, \\nsuch as resulting from aortic rupture (26–28). Moderate or se-\\nvere apical pleural caps also can be seen in upper lobe fibrosis, \\nincluding pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (29).Architectural Distortion (Pathology) (Fig 28)\\nArchitectural distortion is characterized by the focal or dif-\\nfuse derangement of the normal pulmonary anatomy, with \\nabnormal displacement or disruption of airways*, vessels, and \\ninterstitium*. It is typically accompanied by volume loss* and \\nis commonly seen in fibrotic lung diseases (30,31).\\nAsbestosis (Pathology) (Fig 29)\\nAsbestosis is an occupational lung disease characterized by \\nlower-lobe predominant pulmonary fibrosis caused by inhala-\\ntion of asbestos fibers. Once established, fibrosis can progress. \\nHowever, even without progression, the risk of lung cancer is \\nincreased. In addition, asbestos exposure increases the risk of \\nmesothelioma. However, asbestosis is usually associated with \\nhigh levels of asbestos exposure, in distinction to mesothe-\\nlioma. Although pleural plaques, calcified or noncalcified, \\nmay also be identified, their presence is not essential for the \\ndiagnosis (pleural plaque*) (32,33).\\nAspiration (Pathology)\\nAspiration is the unintended inhalation of solid and/or fluid \\nsubstances (“aspirate”). Depending on its location and ex-\\ntent within the airways*, the aspirate can cause atelectasis*, \\ninflammation (“aspiration pneumonitis/bronchiolitis”), or \\ninfection (“aspiration pneumonia”). Changes caused by aspi-\\nration are most commonly seen in the posterior portions of \\nthe lungs and predispose to infection with anaerobic bacteria. \\nSequelae of aspiration, including scarring and bronchiectasis, \\ncan be seen in variable anatomic locations but tend to follow \\nthe direction of gravity (34,35).\\nAtelectasis (Pathology) (Figs 30–40)\\nAtelectasis is a partial or complete collapse* of the lung. Atel-\\nectasis can be caused by loss of negative pressure in the pleural \\nspace and/or by compression of lung parenchyma* (eg, by \\npleural effusions*), by resorption of air following obstruction \\n(eg, by a foreign body or a neoplasm), or by an increase in al-\\nveolar surface tension (eg, by surfactant dysfunction). Atelec-\\ntasis shows lower volume and higher attenuation than normal \\nlung tissue and is often associated with abnormal displace-\\nment of fissures (fissure*), bronchi, vessels, hyperinflation of \\nadjacent lobes (lobe*), or obscuration of cardiac and medias-\\ntinal interfaces (36,37).\\n• Lobar: atelectasis of an entire pulmonary lobe* (Figs \\n30–37).\\n• Linear (formerly “plate-like” or “band-like”): descriptor \\nfor local atelectasis with a linear, plate-like, or band-\\nlike shape (Figs 38, 39).\\nOften seen in dependent lung regions, paralleling the hemi-\\ndiaphragms on chest radiographs and the chest wall on CT \\nexaminations. Of note, the geometric definition of “line” re-\\nfers to a one-dimensional structure. While the cross-sectional \\nappearance of an atelectasis may appear linear, the atelectasis \\nitself has greater dimensionality than a line.')]"
